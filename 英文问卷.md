## Part 4: Modeling and Calculation Method Assessment

### 24. For calculating the probability of occurrence of cause labels under different line loss types, which method do you think is more reasonable?{Single Choice}
- For each line loss type, use fixed weights for key indicators, key archive change records, and key events
- For each line loss type, dynamically adjust the weights of key indicators, key archive change records, and key events
- For each cause label under each line loss type, set different weight models separately
